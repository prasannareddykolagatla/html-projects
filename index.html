The film did well commercially and earned ₹250 crore (equivalent to ₹334 crore or US$40 million in 2023) in its entire theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing Kannada film until it was surpassed by its sequel. It turned out to be a cult hit.[4] At the 66th National Film Awards, the film won two awards for Stunt Choreography and Best Special Effects.[8] At the 66th Filmfare Awards South, the film won two awards from five nominations, including the award for Best Film and Best Actor for Yash.
