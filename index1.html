      <u><b>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle</b></u>
      is a 2025 Japanese animated dark fantasy action film adapting the Infinity
      Castle arc of Koyoharu Gotouge’s manga. Directed by Haruo Sotozaki and
      produced by Ufotable, it serves as a direct sequel to Season 4 of the
      anime and is the first film of a trilogy announced in June 2024. Unlike
      the previous compilation films, this is a full cinematic adaptation due to
      the arc’s scale and intensity. Released in Japan on July 18, 2025, and
      internationally soon after, the film grossed around $780 million
      worldwide, breaking multiple records including becoming the
      highest-grossing Japanese film and one of the highest-earning animated
      films ever. It received widespread praise for its visuals, action, and
      storytelling, despite some pacing criticism, and was even nominated for
      major awards like the Golden Globes.
